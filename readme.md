##### Lambda expressions

    Describe and develop code that uses Java inner class, including
    nested class, static class, local class, and anonymous class
    
    Describe and write functional interfaces
    
    Describe a lambda expression;refactor the code that uses an annonymous inner class
    to use a lambda expression; describe type inferance and target typing.
    
##### Using built-in LambdaTypes

    Describe the interfaces of the java.util.function package
    Develop code that uses the Function interface
    Develop code that uses the Consumer interface
    Develop code that uses the Supplier interface
    Develop code that uses the UnaryOperator interface
    Develop code that uses the Predicate interface
    Develop code that uses the primitive and binary variations of the base
    interfaces of the java.util.function package
    Develop code that uses a method reference, including refactoring a lambda expression
    to a method reference.

##### Filter Collections with Lambdas

    Develop codes that iterates a collection by using forEach() method and method chaining.
    Describe the Stream interface and pipelines
    Filter collection by using lambda expressions.
    Identify the lambda operations that are lazy.
    
##### Collection Operations with Lambda
    
    Develop code to extract data from an object by using map() method
    Search for data by using method such as FindFirst(), findAny(), anyMatch(),
    allMatch(),and noneMatch()
    Describe the unique characteristics of the Optional class.
    Perfom calculations by using Java Stream methods, such as count(),max(),min(),
    average(),and sum()
    Sort a collection by using lambda expresions.
    Develop code that uses the Stream.collect() method and Collectors class methods,
    such as averagingDouble(),groupingBy(),joining(),and partitioningBy()
    
##### Parallelal Streams

    Develop code that uses parallelal streams
    Implement decomposition and reduction in streams.
    
##### Lambda Cookbook

    Develope code that uses JAVA SE 8 collection improvements, including Collection.removeIf(),
    List.replaceAll(),Map.computeIfAbsent(),and Map.computeIfPresent()
    Develop code that uses JAVA SE 8 I/0 improvements, including Files.find(),Files.walk(),
    and lines() methods.
    Use the merge() and flatMap() methods.
    Develop codes that creates a stream by using the Arrays.stream(), and IntStream.range()
    methods.
    
##### Method Enhancements
    
    Add static methods to interfaces
    Define and use a default method of an interface and describe the inherintances rules
    for the default method.
    
##### Use JAVA SE Date/Time API

    Create and manage date-timeand time-based events, including a combinations of date and time
    in a single object, by using LocalDate,LocalTime,LocalDateTIme,Instant,Period,
    and Duration
    Work with dates and times across time zones and manage changes resulting from daylight
    savings, including Format date and times values.
    Define, create and manage date- and time-based events using Instant,Period,Duration,
    and TemporalUnit.
